 * 
 * Examples: 
 * - divide rod on chunks to maximize profit
 * - given unlimited fruits, fill the basket (f.e. apples, oranges) with limited capacity. 
 *   Each fruit gives some profit which needs to be maximised
 *
 * Completed table has (capacity+1) rows: from 0 to capacity
 * and profits.length columns: for each element
 *
 * Table[c][i] represents the maximum profit for capacity `c` calculated for the first `i` items.
 *
 * Table initialized:
 * First row: always 0. For capacity = 0 nothing can be taken.
 * First column capacity / weights[0] * profits[0]. Here we use whole diviging
 *
 * Then we go item by item and fill table for each capacity.
 * If item's weight won't fit into current capacity
 *  then we can't take it and use same profit based on same capacity from previous items
 *
 * Otherwise, we have 2 options: take this item or skip. We fill the table with maximum of these 2:
 * - take: profit[i] + profit of (capacity - weights[i]) for previouew i items. 
 *  Compared with previous also - we used only i-1 items. Here we canre-use i-th item
 * - skip: same as item's weight won't fit into current capacity
 *
 * As the result, last column would contain maximum profits for each capacity from 0 to needed for all items.
